# Plant-it

Plant-it is a self-hosted gardening companion app.
Useful for keeping track of plant care, receiving notifications about when to water plants, uploading plant images, and more.

# Why?

Plant-it is a gardening companion app that helps you take care of your plants.

It does not recommend you about which action to take, instead it is designed to logs the activity you are doing. This is on purpose, I strongly believe that the only one in charge of know when to water your plants, when to fertilize them, etc. is you (with the help of multiple online sources).

Plant-it helps you remember the last time you did a treatment of your plants, which plants you have, collects photos of your plants, and notify you about time passed since last action on them.

# Features highlight

<b>Maintainerr</b> makes managing your media easy.

- Do you hate being the janitor of your server?
- Do you have a lot of media that never gets watched?
- Do your users constantly request media, and let it sit there afterward never to be touched again?

If you answered yes to any of those questions.. You NEED <b>Maintainerr</b>.
It's a one-stop-shop for handling those outlying shows and movies that take up precious space on your server.

# Features

- Configure rules specific to your needs, based off of several available options from Plex, Overseerr, Radarr, and Sonarr.
- Manually add media to a collection, in case it's not included after rule execution. (one-off items that don't match a rule set)
- Selectively exclude media from being added to a collection, even if it matches a rule.
- Show a collection, containing rule matched media, on the Plex home screen for a specific duration before deletion. Think "Leaving soon".
- Optionally, use a manual Plex collection, in case you don't want <b>Maintainerr</b> to add & remove Plex collections at will.
- Manage media straight from the collection within Plex. <b>Maintainerr</b> will sync and add or exclude media to/from the internal collection.

- Remove or unmonitor media from \*arr
- Clear requests from Overseerr
- Delete files from disk

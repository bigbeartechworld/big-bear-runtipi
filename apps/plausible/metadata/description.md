## Why Plausible?

Here's what makes Plausible a great Google Analytics alternative and why we're trusted by thousands of paying subscribers to deliver their website and business insights:

-   **Clutter Free**: Plausible Analytics provides [simple web analytics](https://plausible.io/simple-web-analytics) and it cuts through the noise. No layers of menus, no need for custom reports. Get all the important insights on one single page. No training necessary.
-   **GDPR/CCPA/PECR compliant**: Measure traffic, not individuals. No personal data or IP addresses are ever stored in our database. We don't use cookies or any other persistent identifiers. [Read more about our data policy](https://plausible.io/data-policy)
-   **Lightweight**: Plausible Analytics works by loading a script on your website, like Google Analytics. Our script is [45x smaller](https://plausible.io/lightweight-web-analytics), making your website quicker to load.
-   **Email or Slack reports**: Keep an eye on your traffic with weekly and/or monthly email or Slack reports. You can also get traffic spike notifications.
-   **Open website stats**: You have the option to be transparent and open your web analytics to everyone. Your website stats are private by default but you can choose to make them public so anyone with your custom link can view them.
-   **Define key goals and track conversions**: Set custom events or page URLs as your goals and see how they convert over time to understand and identify the trends that matter. Includes easy ways to track outbound link clicks and 404 error pages.
-   **Search keywords**: Integrate your dashboard with Google Search Console to get the most accurate reporting on your search keywords.
-   **SPA support**: Plausible is built with modern web frameworks in mind and it works automatically with any pushState based router on the frontend. We also support frameworks that use the URL hash for routing. See [our documentation](https://plausible.io/docs/hash-based-routing).

## ü•î Live Demo

Try it!

https://demo.uptime.kuma.pet

It is a temporary live demo, all data will be deleted after 10 minutes. The server is located in Tokyo, so if you live far from there, it may affect your experience. I suggest that you should install and try it out for the best demo experience.

VPS is sponsored by Uptime Kuma sponsors on [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/uptime-kuma)! Thank you so much!

## Installation Notes

To enable OAUTH integrations you will need to enable the "expose app" option and configure a URL in Tipi. This setting can be changed at a later date if an integration is identified that needs it.

## Easily automate tasks across different services.

n8n is an extendable workflow automation tool. With a fair-code distribution model, n8n will always have visible source code, be available to self-host, and allow you to add your own custom functions, logic and apps. n8n's node-based approach makes it highly
versatile, enabling you to connect anything to everything.

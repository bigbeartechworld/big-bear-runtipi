## Features

[PairDrop](https://pairdrop.net) is a sublime alternative to AirDrop that works on all platforms.

Send images, documents or text via peer to peer connection to devices in the same local network/Wi-Fi or to paired devices. As it is web based, it runs on all devices.

You want to quickly send a file from your phone to your laptop?  
You want to share photos in original quality with friends that use a mixture of Android and iOS?  
You want to share private files peer to peer between Linux systems?  
AirDrop is unreliable again?  
_Send it with PairDrop!_

Developed based on [Snapdrop](https://github.com/RobinLinus/snapdrop)

## A free, self-hostable aggregatorâ€¦ 

FreshRSS is a self-hosted RSS feed aggregator like [Leed](https://github.com/LeedRSS/Leed) or [Kriss Feed](https://tontof.net/kriss/feed/).

It is lightweight, easy to work with, powerful, and customizable.

It is a multi-user application with an anonymous reading mode. It supports custom tags.
There is an API for (mobile) clients, and a [Command-Line Interface](cli/README.md).

Thanks to the [WebSub](https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/) standard (formerly [PubSubHubbub](https://github.com/pubsubhubbub/PubSubHubbub)),
FreshRSS is able to receive instant push notifications from compatible sources, such as [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org), [Friendica](https://friendi.ca), [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/pubsubhubbub/), Blogger, FeedBurner, etc.

FreshRSS natively supports basic Web scraping, based on [XPath](https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-10/), for Web sites not providing any RSS / Atom feed.

Finally, it supports [extensions](#extensions) for further tuning.

Feature requests, bug reports, and other contributions are welcome. The best way to contribute is to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/issues).

# Ntfy: HTTP-Based Notification Service

ntfy (pronounced as 'notify') is a straightforward pub-sub notification service that operates over HTTP. It facilitates the seamless transmission of notifications to your phone or desktop through scripts from any machine, completely free of charge and without the requirement of registration. Furthermore, its open-source nature (as evidenced here) allows you the option to host your own instance.

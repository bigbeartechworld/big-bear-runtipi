## About The Project

Hammond is a self hosted vehicle management system to track fuel and other expenses related to all of your vehicles. 
It supports multiple users sharing multiple vehicles. 
It is the logical successor to Clarkson which has not been updated for quite some time now. 
This repo is again a fork of akhilrex's great [project](https://github.com/akhilrex/hammond).

### Motivation and Developer Notes

As mentioned, this project is a fork of akhilrex's [project](https://github.com/akhilrex/hammond) which is no longer active. 
To prevent the same from happeing to this project, we are seeking to add more maintainers/collaborators who have access to merge PRs.

We are trying our best to update with new features and feedback is very welcome.

The project is written using Go for the backend and Vuejs for the front end.

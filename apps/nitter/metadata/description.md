## Alternative Twitter front-end 

A free and open source alternative Twitter front-end focused on privacy and performance. Inspired by the [Invidious](https://github.com/iv-org/invidious) project.

- No JavaScript or ads
- All requests go through the backend, client never talks to Twitter
- Prevents Twitter from tracking your IP or JavaScript fingerprint
- Uses Twitter's unofficial API (no rate limits or developer account required)
- Lightweight (for [@nim_lang](https://nitter.net/nim_lang), 60KB vs 784KB from twitter.com)
- RSS feeds
- Themes
- Mobile support (responsive design)
- AGPLv3 licensed, no proprietary instances permitted

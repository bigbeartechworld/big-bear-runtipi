## [](https://github.com/Peppermint-Lab/peppermint#motivation)Motivation

-   This was initially a project to tie together my react and nodeJS skills and show something for my portfolio
-   It looked terrible! But it worked and showed functionaility, which got me a job.
-   Learn and deploy with docker
-   Redo the UI, completly from the ground up. Which has now been completed and for me looks great.
-   Build on this foundation and create a fully fledged product which offers what the big boys offer, but, at a much better ROI than signing up for zendesk etc.

## State of the project

HedgeDoc 1.x is stable and used around the world, but the codebase has [grown over time](https://hedgedoc.org/history/),
making it hard to add new features.  
We are currently working on HedgeDoc 2, a complete rewrite of HedgeDoc. Please note the following:

- This branch contains the latest development code and does not implement all features yet.
  **If you are looking for the 1.x source code, have a look at the [master branch](https://github.com/hedgedoc/hedgedoc/tree/master).**
- The 1.x release is maintenance-only. We do not accept feature requests or PRs for this release anymore and may choose
  to close non-critical bug reports, if the bug will be non-existent in 2.0.
- HedgeDoc 2 will be split in two components. The backend and the frontend. Both are present in this repository.

**Jellyseerr** is a free and open source software application for managing requests for your media library. It is a a fork of Overseerr built to bring support for Jellyfin & Emby media servers!

_The original Overseerr team have been busy and Jellyfin/Emby support aren't on their roadmap, so we started this project as we wanted to bring the Overseerr experience to the Jellyfin/Emby Community!_

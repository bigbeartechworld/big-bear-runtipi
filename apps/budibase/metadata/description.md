## âœ¨ Features

### Build and ship real software

Unlike other platforms, with Budibase you build and ship single page applications. Budibase applications have performance baked in and can be designed responsively, providing your users with a great experience.
<br /><br />

### Open source and extensible

Budibase is open-source - licensed as GPL v3. This should fill you with confidence that Budibase will always be around. You can also code against Budibase or fork it and make changes as you please, providing a developer-friendly experience.
<br /><br />

### Load data or start from scratch

Budibase pulls in data from multiple sources, including MongoDB, CouchDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Airtable, S3, DynamoDB, or a REST API. And unlike other platforms, with Budibase you can start from scratch and create business apps with no datasources. [Request new datasources](https://github.com/Budibase/budibase/discussions?discussions_q=category%3AIdeas).

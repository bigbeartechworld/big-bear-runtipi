  "description": "Rocket.Chat v8 is an open-source fully customizable communications platform developed in JavaScript for organizations with high standards of data protection. This version requires MongoDB 8.2+ and includes significant updates including ABAC for private channels, Matrix federation support, and voice calling improvements. Note: This is a separate app from the legacy v6 version due to breaking changes including mandatory MongoDB 8.2+ upgrade, removal of multiple SMS providers (Twilio only), and elimination of built-in logging (requires Prometheus/Grafana).",
